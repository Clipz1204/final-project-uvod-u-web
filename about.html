          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            The Pokémon Trading Card Game was originally published in Japan in
            October 1996 by Media Factory. While other series of collectible
            Pokémon cards existed in the past (such as the Pocket Monsters
            Carddass Trading Cards released in September 1996), this was the
            first card game based on the Pokémon series. The first Pokémon TCG
            sets took inspiration from the then released Pokémon Red, Green, and
            Blue video games and initially featured illustrations by Ken
            Sugimori, Mitsuhiro Arita and Keiji Kinebuchi. Soon new expansions
            began to release with many new artists contributing artwork. Three
            years later in 1999, Pokémon TCG was introduced in North America by
            Wizards of the Coast with the Base Set, and worldwide soon after. In
            2003, Wizards of the Coast's license was transferred to The Pokémon
            Company International.

          <h2>How to play</h2>
          <p>
            The Pokémon Trading Card Game is a two player game for all ages.
            Each player builds a Deck of sixty (60) cards using a combination of
            various "Pokémon cards" (the main type of cards used to battle),
            "Trainer cards" (cards with special effects), and "Energy cards"
            (cards that are required to perform most "Attacks"). New cards and
            decks are constantly being released, and players may purchase
            "Booster packs" to integrate these cards into their own decks or
            purchase pre-made "Trainer kits" or "Theme Decks" that already have
            all the cards needed to play. The Pokémon Trading Card Game
            officially requires a deck of 60 cards for Standard or Expanded
            play, though shorter Matches can be held with "Half Decks"
            consisting of 30 cards instead. During a 60 card match, only four of
            any one card, excluding Basic Energy cards, are allowed in each
            deck. This is further limited to two of any one card in a Half Deck
            match. Many fans have also created their own game rules and playing
            methods and have websites devoted to providing alternative playing
            methods. These rules and methods are not allowed in Play! Pokémon
            competitions.
